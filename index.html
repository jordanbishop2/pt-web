<p> So what is veganism? Veganism is the abstainance from use or consumption of all animal products, whether that means not eating it, wearing it or using it. People choose to adopt a vegan lifestyle for various reasons- some people are vegan because of animal suffering, others may go vegan merely to reap the potential health benefits of the lifestyle. Though one thing that all vegans have in common is that they are all superheroes. Well, we don't all have powers like your favourite Marvel heroes, but we are all doing our bit to save the world! 

<p>

Not only are animal agriculture and eating meat the biggest causes of global warming, but it's estimated that over 700 million tons of food that could be consumed by humans is fed to livestock each year; veganism could literally help end world hunger. Not only this, but a vegan diet significantly reduces energy consumption while actually purifying the air and conserving water.

Going vegan

</h1>



<p>

Going vegan can seem like a very daunting concept, but not only can veganism offer a sustainable and healthy diet, but it can also be really tasty! A common misconception about veganism is that vegans only eat vegetables- this couldn't be more wrong. Vegan's tend to eat a wide variety of foodsThere is pretty much a vegan version of any non-vegan food you can think of. There's vegan chicken, vegan steak, vegan cheese, vegan chocolate and vegan ice cream to name a few.
